# Raspberry Pi Drowsiness Detection System
Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Drowsiness Detection System project! This system utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect drowsiness in a driver, hosted on a Raspberry Pi. It's designed to promptly alert the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected using an integrated buzzer. 

# Usage
* Camera Setup: Ensure that the camera is properly positioned to capture the driver's face.
* Real-time Drowsiness Detection: The application will continuously monitor the driver's face for signs of drowsiness.
* Alerting Mechanism: When drowsiness is detected, the integrated buzzer will sound to alert the driver

# Technologies Used
* Raspberry Pi: Used as the hardware platform for running the drowsiness detection application.
* Python: Programming language used for the application.
* OpenCV: Library used for computer vision tasks, including face detection.
* TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework used for training and deploying the drowsiness detection model.
* Buzzer: Integrated buzzer used for alerting the driver when drowsiness is detected.
